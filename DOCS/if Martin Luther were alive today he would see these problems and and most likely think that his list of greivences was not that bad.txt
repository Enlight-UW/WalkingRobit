HOLY FUK THERE IS A LOT TO WRITE

Controller Stuff
	See the most recent controller image in this directory

	Possible buttons:
		BLUE  : https://www.adafruit.com/product/1477
		RED   : https://www.adafruit.com/product/1439
		WHITE : https://www.adafruit.com/product/1479
		GREEN : https://www.adafruit.com/product/1440
		
		Why I like these:
			-They are momentary buttons, they do not stay down after pressure has been applied
			-They include their own housing meaning it will be much easier to mount them in the controller and swap them out if they break
			-They are relatively cheap per unit
		
		TOTAL COST W/ SHIPPING: $16.80 for 8 buttons
		
		
	BETTER BUTTONS :

	work directly on a breadboard and are like 1/3 of the price of the other ones
			
			
			
			
			
OTHER IDEAS
	Have the Enlight logo on the controller much like a nintendo or xbox one
